Project Name
------------
Using spatial and phylogentic leaf-trait variance partitioning to determine trait diversity and drivers of community structure along an elevation gradient in Southwestern China

---------------
Project Summary
---------------
In August 2016 we went to the Alpine Ecosystem Observation and Experiment Station of Mt. Gongga located in Moxi, China for a plant traits course. As part of this course, we sampled a variety of plants from the 4 field sites on Mt. Gongga being used for an ongoing experiment. We then sampled leaf traits from these plants to add to a growing database of leaf traits from this site.
